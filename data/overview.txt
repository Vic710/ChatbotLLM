Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes.

Types of Diabetes:
1. Type 1 Diabetes:
   - An autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
   - Usually diagnosed in children and young adults.
   - Requires insulin therapy for life.

2. Type 2 Diabetes:
   - The most common form of diabetes.
   - The body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin.
   - Often associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.
   - Can be managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, and insulin if necessary.
